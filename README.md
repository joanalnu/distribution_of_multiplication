# Distribution of Multiplication
This is the code for a paper (see [Paper](https://github.com/joanalnu/distribution_of_multiplication/.pfd))(https://github.com/joanalnu/distribution_of_multiplication/blob/main/Computational_analysis_of_the_density_of_integer_multiplications_and_primer_numbers_in_the_range_of__I____1__10_6__.pdf))).

The code is stored in the repository as a ipynb file. To run the code, we recommend to clone the repository and run it on Jupyter Notebook.
